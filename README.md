## Fashion Algorithm
- This is a more basic version of the algorithm I build for Quture Fashion, for privacy reasons the exact code is not shown
- The differences include a 60%/40% split of matching genres in our MongoDB using PyMongo and the code shown in this repo with TensorFlow

FASHION RECCOMENDATION ALGORITHM (Python, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Tkinter, Cv2)
- Developed a recommendation algorithm with Tensorflow VGG16 model for image classification and 190+ user images.
- Built recommendation model by finding the cosine similarity between the input image and the dataset using Sklearn.
- Employed Matplotlib to show the input image and similar images; used Tkinter to create a GUI for users to select images.
- Built using  Python, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Tkinter, Cv2
- Input any image of clothing and get similar images from the 100+ clothing pieces in the uploads file
- Uses a cosine similarity function and a similarity matrix to reccomend similar images
